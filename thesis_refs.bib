  abstract      = {We introduce an infinite set of jet substructure observables, derived as projections of $N$-point energy correlators, that are both convenient for experimental studies and maintain remarkable analytic properties derived from their representations in terms of a finite number of light ray operators. We show that these observables can be computed using tracking or charge information with a simple reweighting by integer moments of non-perturbative track or fragmentation functions. Our results for the projected $N$-point correlators are analytic functions of $N$, allowing us to derive resummed results to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy for all $N$. We analytically continue our results to non-integer values of $N$ and define a corresponding analytic continuation of the observable, which we term a $\nu$-correlator, that can be measured on jets of hadrons at the LHC. This enables observables that probe the leading twist collinear dynamics of jets to be placed into a single analytic family, which we hope will lead to new insights into jet substructure.},

  abstract      = {We derive, in the framework of soft-collinear effective field theory (SCET), a Lagrangian describing the $t$-channel exchange of Glauber quarks in the Regge limit. The Glauber quarks are not dynamical, but are incorporated through non-local fermionic potential operators. These operators are power suppressed in $|t|/s$ relative to those describing Glauber gluon exchange, but give the first non-vanishing contributions in the Regge limit to processes such as $q\bar q \to gg$ and $q\bar q \to \gamma \gamma$. They therefore represent an interesting subset of power corrections to study. The structure of the operators, which describe certain soft and collinear emissions to all orders through Wilson lines, is derived from the symmetries of the effective theory combined with constraints from power and mass dimension counting, as well as through explicit matching calculations. Lightcone singularities in the fermionic potentials are regulated using a rapidity regulator, whose corresponding renormalization group evolution gives rise to the Reggeization of the quark at the amplitude level and the BFKL equation at the cross section level. We verify this at one-loop, deriving the Regge trajectory of the quark in the $3$ color channel, as well as the leading logarithmic BFKL equation. Results in the $\bar 6$ and $15$ color channels are obtained by the simultaneous exchange of a Glauber quark and a Glauber gluon. SCET with quark and gluon Glauber operators therefore provides a framework to systematically study the structure of QCD amplitudes in the Regge limit, and derive constraints on higher order amplitudes.},

The event topology is given by ep-> e X Y, in which the system X, containing at least two jets, is separated from a leading low-mass proton remnant system Y by a large rapidity gap. The dijet cross sections are compared with NLO QCD predictions based on diffractive parton densities previously obtained from a QCD analysis of inclusive diffractive DIS cross sections by H1. In DIS, the dijet data are well described, supporting the validity of QCD factorisation. The diffractive DIS dijet data are more sensitive to the diffractive gluon density at high fractional parton momentum than the measurements of inclusive diffractive DIS. In photoproduction, the predicted dijet cross section has to be multiplied by a factor of approximately 0.5 for both direct and resolved photon interactions to describe the measurements. The ratio of measured dijet cross section to NLO prediction in photoproduction is a factor 0.5+-0.1 smaller than the same ratio in DIS. This suppression is the first clear observation of QCD hard scattering factorisation breaking at HERA. The measurements are also compared to the two soft colour neutralisation models SCI and GAL. The SCI model describes diffractive dijet production in DIS but not in photoproduction. The GAL model fails in both kinematic regions.},

The small-$x$ resummation is included by means of the BK equation supplemented with a kinematic constraint and subleading corrections. We test the new gluon distributions against existing CMS data for transverse momentum spectra in forward-central dijet production. We obtain results which are largely consistent with our earlier predictions based on model implementation of Sudakov form factors.

The ratios of the pPb and pp distributions are compared to next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations with unbound nucleon and nuclear parton distribution functions (PDFs).

  abstract      = {We discuss the implications of the preliminary CMS dijet data from 5.02 TeV pp and pPb collisions for gluon PDFs of the proton and nuclei. The preliminary pp data show a discrepancy with NLO predictions using for example the CT14 PDFs. We find that this difference cannot be accommodated within the associated scale uncertainties and debate the possible changes needed in the gluon PDF. A similar discrepancy is found between the CMS pPb data and NLO predictions e.g. with the EPPS16 nuclear modifications imposed on the CT14 proton PDFs. When a nuclear modification ratio of the pp and pPb data is constructed, the uncertainties in the scale choices and in proton PDFs effectively cancel and a good agreement between the data and EPPS16 is found, except in some bins at backward rapidities corresponding to large x of the nucleus. To assess the impact of these data on the EPPS16 nuclear PDFs, we use a non-quadratic extension of the Hessian PDF reweighting method. A significant reduction in EPPS16 uncertainties is obtained with the fit supporting strong nuclear shadowing and valence-like antishadowing for gluons. We also indicate the possible extensions needed in the EPPS16 parametrization at large x.},

Within the generalized high-twist approach to multiple parton scattering, such contributions at the leading order in perturbative QCD and large Bjorken momentum fraction $x_B$ can be expressed as a convolution of the multiple parton scattering amplitudes and the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) two-parton correlation matrix elements. We study this medium-induced dijet spectrum and its azimuthal angle correlation under the approximation of small longitudinal momentum transfer in the secondary scattering and the factorization of two-parton correlation matrix elements as a product of quark and gluon TMD parton distribution function (PDF). Using a simple model for gluon saturation based on the parametrized gluon TMD PDF, we can calculate the $x_B$ and $Q^2$ dependence of the saturation scale and parton transport coefficient $\hat q$. Contributions to dijet cross section from double scattering are power-suppressed and only become sizable for mini-jets at small transverse momentum. We find that the total dijet correlation for these mini-jets, which also includes the contribution from single scattering, is sensitive to the transverse momentum broadening in the quark TMD PDF at large $x$ and saturation in the gluon TMD PDF at small $x$ inside the nucleus. The correlation from double scattering is also found to increase with the dijet rapidity gap and have a quadratic nuclear-size dependence because of the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) interference in gluon emission induced by multiple scattering. Experimental measurements of such unique features in the dijet correlation can shed light on the LPM interference in strong interaction and gluon saturation in large nuclei.},

In particular, we reproduce the enhancements seen in the data at both relatively soft and relatively large transverse momenta, with clear physical interpretations. The perturbative predictions however are quite sensitive to the value of the infrared cutoff mimicking the confinement scale, due to the fact that the fragmentation function is not an infrared safe quantity. To remedy this, we propose a new observable -- the (primary) subjet fragmentation function -- which is infrared safe and has features similar to the fragmentation function. We provide predictions for this observable in the vacuum and in heavy-ion collisions that could be tested against the experimental data.},

Recent measurements of the nuclear modification factors of $B$ mesons and $B$-decayed $D$ mesons by the CMS Collaboration provide a unique opportunity to study the flavor hierarchy of jet quenching. Using a linear Boltzmann transport model combined with hydrodynamics simulation, we study the energy loss and nuclear modification for heavy and light flavor jets in high-energy nuclear collisions. By consistently taking into account both quark and gluon contributions to light and heavy flavor hadron productions within a next-to-leading order perturbative QCD framework, we obtain, for the first time, a satisfactory description of the experimental data on the nuclear modification factors for charged hadrons, $D$ mesons, $B$ mesons and $B$-decayed $D$ mesons simultaneously over a wide range of transverse momenta (8-300~GeV). This presents a solid solution to the flavor puzzle of jet quenching and constitutes a significant step towards the precision study of jet-medium interaction. Our study predicts that at transverse momenta larger than 30-40~GeV, $B$ mesons also exhibit similar suppression effects to charged hadrons and $D$ mesons, which may be tested by future measurements.},

  abstract      = {The energy-energy correlator (EEC) in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) serves as an important event shape for probing the substructure of jets in high-energy collisions. A significant progress has been make in understanding the collinear limit, where the angle between two detectors approaches zero, from the factorization formula in QCD and the light-ray Operator Product Expansion (OPE) in Conformal Field Theory. Building upon prior research on the renormalization of light-ray operators, we take an innovative step to extend the light-ray OPE into non-conformal contexts, with a specific emphasis on perturbative QCD. Our proposed form of the light-ray OPE is constrained by three fundamental properties: Lorentz symmetry, renormalization group invariance, and constraints from physical observables. This extension allows us to derive a factorization formula for the collinear limit of EEC, facilitating the future exploration and understanding on subleading power corrections in collinear limit.},

  abstract      = {Studies of fully-reconstructed jets in heavy-ion collisions aim at extracting thermodynamical and transport properties of hot and dense QCD matter. Recently, a plethora of new jet substructure observables have been theoretically and experimentally developed that provide novel precise insights on the modifications of the parton radiation pattern induced by a QCD medium. This report, summarizing the main lines of discussion at the 5th Heavy Ion Jet Workshop and CERN TH institute "Novel tools and observables for jet physics in heavy-ion collisions" in 2017, presents a first attempt at outlining a strategy for isolating and identifying the relevant physical processes that are responsible for the observed medium-induced jet modifications. These studies combine theory insights, based on the Lund parton splitting map, with sophisticated jet reconstruction techniques, including grooming and background subtraction algorithms.},

A number of important hard scattering processes are available, together with an interface via the Les Houches Accord to specialized matrix element generators for additional processes. The simulation of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics includes a range of models and allows new models to be added by encoding the Feynman rules of the model. The parton-shower approach is used to simulate initial- and final-state QCD radiation, including colour coherence effects, with special emphasis on the correct description of radiation from heavy particles. The underlying event is simulated using an eikonal multiple parton-parton scattering model. The formation of hadrons from the quarks and gluons produced in the parton shower is described using the cluster hadronization model. Hadron decays are simulated using matrix elements, where possible including spin correlations and off-shell effects.},

  abstract      = {Jet substructure is a powerful tool to probe the time evolution of a parton shower. However, many of the analysis methods used to extract splitting formation times from jet substructure, such as Soft Drop grooming and the Lund plane, focus on the hardest radiation of the jet. A complementary observable with growing theoretical and experimental interest, the 2-point Energy Correlator (EEC), re-contextualizes jet substructure study by using the distribution of angular distance of all combinations of two final state particles within a jet. This distribution is weighted by the product of the fractions of jet energy that each of the constituents carry, and thus is infrared-and-collinear safe. The EEC can reveal the separation between two distinct regimes: effects originating from free hadrons at small opening angles and from perturbative fragmentation of quarks and gluons at large opening angles. In these proceedings, the first measurement of the EEC at RHIC is presented, using the data taken at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV $pp$ collisions by STAR. The EEC will be shown for several full jet transverse momentum selections and compared to predictions from the PYTHIA-8 Detroit tune. This study is useful as a baseline for comparisons to future studies in heavy-ion collisions, which will provide information about how the quark-gluon plasma interacts with the jet across different angular scales.},

  abstract      = {While "quark" and "gluon" jets are often treated as separate, well-defined objects in both theoretical and experimental contexts, no precise, practical, and hadron-level definition of jet flavor presently exists. To remedy this issue, we develop and advocate for a data-driven, operational definition of quark and gluon jets that is readily applicable at colliders. Rather than specifying a per-jet flavor label, we aggregately define quark and gluon jets at the distribution level in terms of measured hadronic cross sections. Intuitively, quark and gluon jets emerge as the two maximally separable categories within two jet samples in data. Benefiting from recent work on data-driven classifiers and topic modeling for jets, we show that the practical tools needed to implement our definition already exist for experimental applications. As an informative example, we demonstrate the power of our operational definition using Z+jet and dijet samples, illustrating that pure quark and gluon distributions and fractions can be successfully extracted in a fully well-defined manner.},

  abstract      = {In this document the PHENIX collaboration proposes a major upgrade to the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. This upgrade, sPHENIX, enables an extremely rich jet and beauty quarkonia physics program addressing fundamental questions about the nature of the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP), discovered experimentally at RHIC to be a perfect fluid. The startling dynamics of the QGP on fluid-like length scales is an emergent property of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), seemingly implicit in the Lagrangian but stubbornly hidden from view. QCD is an asymptotically free theory, but how QCD manifests as a strongly coupled fluid with specific shear viscosity near $T_C$, as low as allowed by the uncertainty principle, is as fundamental an issue as that of how confinement itself arises.},
