\chapter{The sPHENIX detector}
The sPHENIX detector is part of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) complex at Brookhaven National Laboratories (BNL) in Upton, New York. 
RHIC is one of two major circular particle colliders in the world, the other of which is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. 
Over the course of the sPHENIX experiment which will run from run 23 until RHIC ceases operations after run 25, RHIC will be colliding gold nuclei and protons with run 23 having been dedicated to commissioning Au+Au running, 
run 24 dedicated to p+p with three weeks of Au+Au for further tracking commissioning and run 25 dedicated to physics running in Au+Au collisions. 
RHIC runs with a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 200 GeV$ for both protons and gold, and additionally is the sole collider that collides polarized protons, which allows for more in depth studies of spin physics. 
At RHIC, sPHENIX's forerunner, the Pioneering High Energy Nuclear Interaction eXperiment (PHENIX), performed the first measurement of the Quark Gluon Plasma droplets \cite{QGP_droplets} in nuclei-nuclei collisions. 

sPHENIX is designed to offer significant upgrades to PHENIX, specifically providing increased coverage with hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters, increasing effectiveness in studies of jets and heavy flavor at mid-to-high Bjorken x \cite{sPHENIX_TDR}\cite{sPHENIX_whitepaper}\cite{sPHENIX_physics_goals}
Broadly, sPHENIX can be broken into three categories of subsystem: Calorimeters, Tracking and Event characterization.

sPHENIX is constructed around a 1.5 Tesla superconducting magnet, cooled by liquid helium, which was previously used on the BABAR experiment at SLAC, with the outer hadronic calorimeter sitting on the outer radius of the magnet, as see in fig \ref{fig:sphenix_detector}
\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
\section{Calorimetery}
	\subsection{Analog Digital Converters and Data Acquisition}
		Beyond the purposes and hardware of the detector itself, one can further characterize the subsystems of sPHENIX into streaming readout and non-streaming detectors, broadly distinguishing the tracking detectors from other subsystems. 
		The non-streaming detectors all use a common data acquisition pipeline and data format. 
		These detectors are readout to analog digital converters boards with 64 channels each, which are then grouped into sets of 3 called an "XMIT" group, which is then read to the data format as a "packet" of 192 channels. 
		Each packet is transmitted from the detector to the computing center on a seperate fiber optic cable that is then read into a digitizer which forms groups of (at most) eight packets that are then assigned to individual data acquisition servers. 
		The digitizing process allows for readback into the detector through a global trigger and timing module, where each DAQ server, can issue comands and readback to an event building logic that will then flow back to the detector controling the same XMIT groups. 
		Each set of (at most) 4 XMIT groups is arranged into a crate with a single crate controller that recieves trigger and timing information distributed via a global timing and level 1 trigger module (GL1/GTM) that is then processed through a clockmaster for each digitizer rack, which will hold between 1 and 4 crates, depending of the needs of the subsystem. 
		The data read out to each DAQ server is then stored in the "Purschke Raq Data Format" or prdf file that provides an event structure consisiting of a header with some identifying information and seperate headers for each packet, but is otherwise comprehensible as an ASCII file. 
		This event structure allows for easy offline combination of events across the calorimeters while keeping individual file size buffers relatively small, as each packet has timing information along with an event number relative to the run that is inhreited fom the timing module. 
		This DAQ configuration is currently used for the calorimeters, the event plane detector and the minimuum bias detector, which allows for faster event building to verify data quality and alignment. 
		The tracking detectors untilize a streaming readout format that creates event pools that are then associated with beam crossing timings provided by the RHIC clock and can be matched onto the GTM timing in offline analysis. 
		This process is slow, and the fully implementation of event combination is still under developement, not accounting for event reconstructions which involves track matching across subsystems and will be discussed in section \ref{sec:events}.
		\subsubsection{ADC Zero Suppression}
			\label{sec:zero_supr}
			While this system allows for a simplified readout of the calorimetery system, one expects that, for the average event, most of the towers will be dominated by noise, thus one wastes signifigant computational resources on reading and storing data that will be immediately discarded.
			This decreases readout rates, runs the risk of filling the storage systems and increases the likelyhood of register errors that require restarting runs; in summary, these null data points give no useful physics and hurt our ability to consitently take data. 
			The ADC and readout electronic systems are thus equipped with a zero supression system that alows for onboard discrimination and data reduction. 
			At the FPGA level, each channel is individually evaluated by taking a post-pre measurement and comparing to a threshold derived from studies of average noise in each channel
			\begin{equation}
				ADC_{\textrm{sample 6}} - ADC_{\textrm{sample 0}} > E_{\textrm{cut off}}
				\label{eq:post_pre}
			\end{equation}
			Where the evaluation shown in eq (\ref{eq:post_pre}) assumes that the ADC readout has been properly timed in relative to the trigger such that the peak of well formed data should be centered near sample 6 (of 12, 16 or 31), and one can take a cutoff with resolution as wide as a single number and as granular as a tower-by-tower volume. 
			Studies have been performed at sPHENIX to establish good thresholds for this zero-supression approach and validate that this will not introduce biasing into the detector \cite{Lis2020}. 
			%put in an averaging noise plot here 
	\subsection{Hadronic Calorimeters}
		sPHENIX's power in jet physics comes in large part from its calorimeter systems, including two seperate hadronic calorimeters. 
		The outer and inner hadronic calorimeter (OHCal and IHCal respectively) are both divided into 24 bins in $\eta$ with coverage of $|\eta| \leq 1.1$  and full $\varphi$ coverage with 64 bins in $\varphi$, grouped in $\varphi$ into 32 sectors in each calorimeter. 
		Each hadronic calorimeter therefore has tower size of $\delta \eta = 0.092$ and $\delta \varphi=0.098$.  
		The outer hadronic calorimeter is constructed of steel and sits outside of the magnet, with inner radius of $r=1.82$ m and outer radius of $r=2.69$ m. 
		The inner hadronic calormeter is constructed of aluminum and sits just inside the magnet, with inner radus of $r=1/16$ m and outer radius of $r=1.37$ m. 
		Each tower corresponds to a readout board that sums readout from four scintillator paddles embeded into the calorimeter as show in fig. \ref{fig:hcal}. 
		These interface boards form a single readout channel, and can be indvidually teste via a pulser system that injects charge into the interface board testing readback independent of scintillator response, and LED system that injects a fixed pulse of light into the scintilators to test behavior of the Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). 
		Output of each of these systems is shown in fig \ref{fig:hcal_tests}

		\subsubsection{Calibration}
			The hadronic calorimeters were intially calibrated through use of cosmic ray muons, matching the spectra to Monte Carlo 
			generated through EcoMug and GEANT4 \cite{HCal_Calib}. 
			This calibration is updated throughout the run via continued cosmic ray studies in between physics data taking, in addition
			to ongoing work on in-situo calibrations using tower-slope methods \cite{tower_slope_hcal}. 
			These calibrations have yeilded an average conversion factor for the OHCal of and the IHCal of %*put ing the factor here*%
	\subsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}
		Moving in one layer from the hadronic calorimeter, the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) has the same coverage in $\eta-\varphi$ space,
		but has 16 times as many towers with 96 bins in $\eta$ and 256 bins in $\varphi$. 
		The EMCal is constructed of blocks of tungsten with embedded scintilationg fibers, 
		and had inner radius $r=0.9$ m and outer radius of $r=1.16$ m.
		Similarly to the HCals, the EMCal is also equipped with a pulser and LED, although the increased number of towers and higher varaiblility 
		in response requires that different pulse widths be used for seperate sets of towers to prevent saturation and clipping on the LED pulse.
		\subsubsection{Calibration}
			The EMCal was calibrated to the $\pi^0$ mass through the $\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma \gamma$ decay channel with additional corrections
			applied via the tower slope. 
			The mean $m_{\pi^0}$ and width are used as quality assurance plots to monitor radiation damage to the EMCal on an ongoing basis.
	\subsection{Zero Degree Calorimeter}
		The Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) is a small transverse energy hadron detector that positioned outside of the experiment hall, in the tunnels along the beam pipe, 18 m from the interaction point on both side.
		The ZDC is used to detect spectator neutrons to allow for the calculation of multiplicity and event geometry, making it an overlapping detector between the calorimeters and the event characterization \cite{sphenix_ZDC}. 
		In addition, the ZDC provides a good proxy for total collision rates, useful for both real time monitoring of beam conditions and 
		The sPHENIX ZDC is one of two detectors that was preserved from PHENIX, with minor repairs and upgrades to improve running.
		In pp collisions, the ZDC provides additional utility as a spin momentum detector that allows for measurment of the spin patterns of the RHIC beam through the Vernier Scan. 
		This functionality is pivotal for the development of sPHENIX's spin physics program in pp and its extensions into the continuing physics goals at the Electron Ion Collider (EIC)\cite{sphenix_ZDC}.
		For the purposes of this work, the ZDC is not utilized for either spin phyiscs or trigger capabilities and serves primiarily to help establish cross-sections for error determination. 
		While this work does not dive into the subject of spin depenendence, such topics are a natural extension and present an intresting avenue for future studies in this vien to be done with the sPHENIX Run 24 data set. 

\section{Tracking}
	The sPHENIX tracking system consits of the Silicon tracking and vertexing detectors and the gas based trackers.
	These systems are designed for fast readout, precise momentum resolution and secondary vertex detection
	\subsection{TPC Outer Tracker}
	The TPC Outer Tracker (TPOT) was designed as a minimal add-on to improve tracking effeciency and resolution by providing additional track points.

	The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is a gas based detector designed to track 
	\subsection{Intermediate Silicon Tracking Detector}
	The INTermediate Silicon Tracking detector (INTT) consists of two layers of semiconducting silicon 
	\subsection{Micromegas Vertex Detector}
	The Micromegas Vertex detector (MVTX) is a silicon based vertexing detector based on a similar system at the ALICE experiment of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
	This detector sits closest into the beam pipe and is instrumental in the open heavy flavour program of sPHENIX \cite {sPHENIX_TDR}
	The MVTX is comprised of three layers of% some number8, 12 and 21%
	of staves in concentric rings.

	\subsection{Minimum Bias Detector}
	The sPHENIX Minimum Bias Detector (MBD) is the other detector preserved from PHENIX, when it was called the Beam-Beam Counter (BBC). 
	This detector is situated  
\section{Triggers}
	The sPHENIX detector has a number of triggers at its disposal to allow for online event type selections for the triggered readout system: the EMCal, the HCals, the ZDC, the MBD, the sEPD and--for run 2024--the TPC.
	Starting in run 2024, available triggers are ZDC and Minimum Bias in single and coincidence modes, a restricted vertex Minimum Bias trigger, four jet triggers at differing minimum energy thresholds (6-12 GeV with variation through the run), four photon triggers at differing minimum energy thresholds (2-10 GeV with variation through out the run), random triggers, clock triggers and jet with Minimum Bias triggers. 
	In order to decrease busy signals, the overall trigger rate is scaled down to 8 kHz, taking 100 Hz of clock triggers as a control, full rate rare event (jet and photon) and minmum bias filling the remaining.

\chapter{Monte Carlo Simulations}
	For proton-proton collisions, sPHENIX has $~10^8$ fully reconstructed events from Pythia 8 and Herwig 7 for 2$\rightarrow$2 and minimum bias (soft QCD) events that are then reconstructed using GEANT. 
	While there is a jet sample that has been performed with the detroit tune \cite{Detroit_tune} and there is an existing, equivilent tune for Herwig \cite{New_Haven_Vanderbilt_tune}, in this work, I focus on the default tuned sample as there is a wider dataset from which to draw.

\chapter{The Energy Correlator and the primary vertex}
	\label{ch:ENC_th}
	Considering the limitations of Calorimetry only measuremet with RHIC one is 
So the energy correlator alows a look back, I guess thats the relevant bit? 
	Point being, if the jet points back to the primary vertex, the share of the energy between the jets and the composition of those jets is directly determined by the $2 \rightarrow 2$ scattering and is thus sensitive to the parton distribution functions of the beam particles. 
	Starting from the definition of the energy correlator given in \cite{Larkoski2013}:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{E}_{N} = \int \frac{\dd \Omega}{2} \int \dd \vec{n}_{12} \frac{\langle \varepsilon \left( \vec{n}_1 \right) ... \varepsilon \left(\vec{n}_2 \right)\rangle}{Q^2} \delta\left( \vec{n}_1 \cdot \vec{n}_2 - 2|\vec{n}_1|||\vec{n}_2|\cos  \theta \right)
		\label{eq:ENC}
	\end{equation}
	Where $\varepsilon \left( \vec{n}_i \right)$ is the energy flow operator defined as 
	\begin{equation}
		\varepsilon \left( \vec{n}_i \right) = \lim_{r\rightarrow \infty} r^2 \int_{-\infty}^\infty \dd t \vec{n}^i T^0_{i}\left( t, r \vec{n} \right) 
		\label{eq:enrgy_flow_op}
	\end{equation}
	\section{The primary vertex and inteeraction}
	The goal of this work is to extract gluon distributions from the jet, thus one must consider those intial verticies that (to first order) produce the gluon-quark, gluon-gluon, and quark-quark dijet events. 
	To this end, one considers the following tree level diagrams 
%	\begin{figure}
%		\begin{centering}
% gotta actually make these feynman diagrams
	While the processes are not imediately apparent in the final state of the jet, one notes that the two and three point energy correlators give a useful distinction as the jet function can be divided out, leaving a vertex dependent term at $R_L \approx 2 R_{\textrm{jet}}$

\section{Jet Identification Algorithms}
\label{sec:toy_jet_id}
As discussed in chapter \ref{ch:LR}, there are a variety of jet finding algorithms that prioritize different theoretical aspects of the underlying physics while being experimentally realizable \cite{Dokshitzer1997} \cite{Atkin2015}. 

In general, a jet identification algorithm needs to be IRC safe. 
That is, the jet object needs to display invariance in the Infrared (IR) and Collinear regimes, managing real-virtual cancellation and keeping results meaningful for emission and splitting respectively.

\chapter{Measuring the Energy Correlator}
	\section{Discretization and Efficiency}
	In the discussion of the energy correlator in chapter \ref{ch:ENC_th}, we had been working in an idealized regime where the measurement is able to be resolved to arbitary size, however, this is limited by the physical reality of the detector systems.

	Even in simulations, one finds that the practical reality of making measurements of the Energy correlator is severly hamstrung by the use of tower size objects rather than the truth particles that make up our idealized toy jets discussed in section \ref{sec:toy_jet_id}. 
	To study the efficiency loss, one takes the identified truth jet objects from Monte Carlo Simulations (Pythia8 and Herwig for pp; sHIJING, EPOS4, AMPT for AuAu) and runs them through Geant simulations to model detector effects.
	One then takes the initial truth jet, draws a circle that encloses the truth particles, and projects this out onto the calibrated tower response in each calorimeter, as well as runs an anti-k$_{\textrm{T}}$ jet identification algorithm to simulate jet reconstruction.
	These three object types (truth jet, projective cone and reconstructed jet) are collected into sets and the measurement of the two- and three-point energy correlators is performed using the defintion in eq \ref{eq:calo_enc}
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
			\left< E2C \left( R_L \right) \right> &= \frac{1}{N_\textrm{events}} \sum_{\textrm{events}} \frac{1}{N_\textrm{jet}} \sum_{N_{\textrm{jets}}} \sum_{i,j \in \textrm{Jet Consitutents}} \frac{E_{i} E_{j}}{E_\textrm{jets}^2} \delta \left( R_{ij} - R_L \right) \\  \\
			\left< E3C \left( R_L \right) \right> &= \frac{1}{N_\textrm{events}} \sum_{\textrm{events}} \frac{1}{N_\textrm{jet}} \sum_{N_{\textrm{jets}}} \sum_{i,j,k \in \textrm{Jet Consitutents}} \frac{E_{i} E_{j} E_{k}}{E_\textrm{jets}^3} \delta \left( \textrm{max}{R_{i,j,k}} - R_L \right) 
		\end{split}
		\label{eq:calo_enc}
	\end{equation}

	\section{Whole Calorimeter Measurements}
	While the Energy correlator is generally studied within a jet, one can make use of the whole calorimeter to compare the energy correlator across all angular seperations to characterize the underlying event. 
	This induces a new computational issue of scale, where the number of calculations goes from $_{50}C_2=1225$ in the HCAL and $_{804} C_2=322,806$ in the EMCAL to $_{1536}C_2 \approx 2.4 \times 10^6$ and $_{24576}C_2 \approx 6 \times 10^8$ in the EMCAL. 
	However, since pp events have relatively low multiplicity in the calormeters as is seen in fig \ref{fig:calo_pp_multiplicity}, one reduces the computational load signifigantly by preprocessing the towers to remove all towers with energy below some threshold, functionally mirroring the zero-suppression procedure discussed in section \ref{sec:zero_supr}.
