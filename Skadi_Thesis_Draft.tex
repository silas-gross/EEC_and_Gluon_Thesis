\chapter{The sPHENIX detector}
The sPHENIX detector is part of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) complex at Brookhaven National Laboratories (BNL) in Upton, New York. 
RHIC is one of two major circlular particle colliders in the world, the other of which is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. 
Over the course of the sPHENIX experiment which will run from run 23 until RHIC ceases opperations after run 25, RHIC will be colliding gold nuclei and protons with run 23 having been dedicated to commissioning Au+Au running, 
run 24 dedicated to p+p with three weeks of Au+Au for further tracking commisioning and run 25 dedicated to physics running in Au+Au collisions. 
RHIC runs with a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 200 GeV$ for both protons and gold, and additionally is the sole collider that collides polarized protons, which allows for more in depth studies of spin physics. 
At RHIC, sPHENIX's forerunner, the Pioneering High Energy Nuclear Interaction eXperiment (PHENIX), perfomed the first measurement of the Quark Gluon Plasma droplets \cite{QGP_droplets} in nuclei-nuclei collisions. 

sPHENIX is designed to offer significant upgrades to PHENIX, specifically provinding increased coverage with hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters, increasing effectiveness in studies of jets and heavy flavor at mid-to-high Bjorken x \cite{sPHENIX_TDR}\cite{sPHENIX_whitepaper}\cite{sPHENIX_physics_goals}
Broadly, sPHENIX can be broken into three categories of subystem: Calorimerters, Tracking and Event characterization.
sPHENIX is constructed around a 4 Tesla superconducting magnet, cooled by liquid helium, which was previously used on the BABAR experiment at SLAC.

\section{Calorimetery}
	\subsection{Hadronic Calorimeters}
		sPHENIX's power in jet physics comes in large part from its calorimeter systems, including two seperate hadronic calorimeters. 
		The outer and inner hadronic calorimeter (OHCal and IHCal respectively) are both divided into 24 bins in $\eta$ with coverage of $|\eta| \leq 1.1$  and full $\varphi$ coverage with 64 bins in $\varphi$, grouped in $\varphi$ into 32 sectors in each calorimeter. 
		Each hadronic calorimeter therefore has tower size of $\delta \eta = 0.092$ and $\delta \varphi=0.098$.  
		The outer hadronic calorimeter is constructed of steel and sits outside of the magnet, with inner radius of $r=$ m and outer radius of $r=$ m. 
		The inner hadronic calormeter is constructed of aluminum and sits just inside the magnet, with inner radus of $r=$ m and outer radius of $r=$ m. 
		Each tower corresponds to a readout board that sums readout from four scintillator paddles embeded into the calorimeter as show in fig. \ref{fig:hcal}. 
		These interface boards form a single readout channel, and can be indvidually teste via a pulser system that injects charge into the interface board testing readback independent of scintillator response, and LED system that injects a fixed pulse of light into the scintilators to test behavior of the Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). 
		Output of each of these systems is shown in fig \ref{fig:hcal_tests}

			\caption{Figuring out the subfigs first. But Left Pulser and Right LED, top IHCAL both OHCAL}

		\end{figure}
		\subsubsection{Calibration}
			The hadronic calorimeters were intially calibrated through use of cosmic ray muons, matching the spectra to Monte Carlo 
			generated by EcoMug \cite{HCal_Calib}. 
			This calibration is updated through out the run via continued cosmic ray studies in between physics data taking in addition
			to ongoing work on in-situo calibrations using tower-slope methods \cite{tower_slope_hcal}. 
			These calibrations have yeilded an average conversion factor for the OHCal of and the IHCal of %*put ing the factor here*%
	\subsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}
		Moving in one layer from the hadronic calorimeter, the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) has the same coverage in $\eta-\varphi$ space,
		but has 16 times as many towers with 96 bins in $\eta$ and 256 bins in $\varphi$. 
		The EMCal is constructed of blocks of tungsten with embedded scintilationg fibers. 
		Similarly to the HCals, the EMCal is also equipped with a pulser and LED, although the increased number of towers and higher varaiblility 
		in response requires that different pulse widths be used for seperate sets of towers to prevent saturation and clipping on the LED pulse.
		\subsubsection{Calibration}
			The EMCal was calibrated to the $\pi^0$ mass through the $\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma \gamma$ decay channel with additional corrections
			applied via the tower slope. 
			The mean $m_{\pi^0}$ and width are used as quality assurance plots to monitor radiation damage to the EMCal on an ongoing basis.

\section{Jet Identification Algorithms}
As discused in chapter \ref{ch:LR}, there are a variety of jet finding algorithims that prioritize different theoretical aspacts of the underlying physics while being experimentally realizable \cite{Dokshitzer1997} \cite{Atkin2015}. 

In general, a jet identification algorithim needs to be IRC safe. 
That is, the jet object needs to display invariance in the Infrared (IR) and Collinear regimes, managing real-virtual cancellation and keeping results meaningful for emmission and splitting respectively.
