\chapter{The sPHENIX detector}
The sPHENIX detector is part of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) complex at Brookhaven National Laboratories (BNL) in Upton, New York. 
RHIC is one of two major circular particle colliders in the world, the other of which is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. 
Over the course of the sPHENIX experiment which will run from run 23 until RHIC ceases operations after run 25, RHIC will be colliding gold nuclei and protons with run 23 having been dedicated to commissioning Au+Au running, 
run 24 dedicated to p+p with three weeks of Au+Au for further tracking commissioning and run 25 dedicated to physics running in Au+Au collisions. 
RHIC runs with a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 200 GeV$ for both protons and gold, and additionally is the sole collider that collides polarized protons, which allows for more in depth studies of spin physics. 
At RHIC, sPHENIX's forerunner, the Pioneering High Energy Nuclear Interaction eXperiment (PHENIX), performed the first measurement of the Quark Gluon Plasma droplets \cite{QGP_droplets} in nuclei-nuclei collisions. 

sPHENIX is designed to offer significant upgrades to PHENIX, specifically providing increased coverage with hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters, increasing effectiveness in studies of jets and heavy flavor at mid-to-high Bjorken x \cite{sPHENIX_TDR}\cite{sPHENIX_whitepaper}\cite{sPHENIX_physics_goals}
Broadly, sPHENIX can be broken into three categories of subsystem: Calorimeters, Tracking and Event characterization.
sPHENIX is constructed around a 1.5 Tesla superconducting magnet, cooled by liquid helium, which was previously used on the BABAR experiment at SLAC.

\section{Calorimetery}
	\subsection{Analog Digital Converters and Data Acquisition}
		Beyond the purposes and hardware of the detector itself, one can further characterize the subsystems of sPHENIX into streaming readout and non-streaming detectors, broadly distinguishing the tracking detectors from other subsystems. 
		The non-streaming detectors all use a common data acquisition pipeline and data format. 
		These detectors are readout to analog digital converters boards with 64 channels each, which are then grouped into sets of 3 called an "XMIT" group, which is then read to the data format as a "packet" of 192 channels. 
		Each packet is transmitted from the detector to the computing center on a seperate fiber optic cable that is then read into a digitizer which forms groups of (at most) eight packets that are then assigned to individual data acquisition servers. 
		The digitizing process allows for readback into the detector through a global trigger and timing module, where each DAQ server, can issue comands and readback to an event building logic that will then flow back to the detector controling the same XMIT groups. 
		Each set of (at most) 4 XMIT groups is arranged into a crate with a single crate controller that recieves trigger and timing information distributed via a global timing and level 1 trigger module (GL1/GTM) that is then processed through a clockmaster for each digitizer rack, which will hold between 1 and 4 crates, depending of the needs of the subsystem. 
		The data read out to each DAQ server is then stored in the "Purschke Raq Data Format" or prdf file that provides an event structure consisiting of a header with some identifying information and seperate headers for each packet, but is otherwise comprehensible as an ASCII file. 
		This event structure allows for easy offline combination of events across the calorimeters while keeping individual file size buffers relatively small, as each packet has timing information along with an event number relative to the run that is inhreited fom the timing module. 
		This DAQ configuration is currently used for the calorimeters, the event plane detector and the minimuum bias detector, which allows for faster event building to verify data quality and alignment. 
		The tracking detectors untilize a streaming readout format that creates event pools that are then associated with beam crossing timings provided by the RHIC clock and can be matched onto the GTM timing in offline analysis. 
		This process is slow, and the fully implementation of event combination is still under developement, not accounting for event reconstructions which involves track matching across subsystems and will be discussed in section \ref{sec:events}.
	\subsection{Hadronic Calorimeters}
		sPHENIX's power in jet physics comes in large part from its calorimeter systems, including two seperate hadronic calorimeters. 
		The outer and inner hadronic calorimeter (OHCal and IHCal respectively) are both divided into 24 bins in $\eta$ with coverage of $|\eta| \leq 1.1$  and full $\varphi$ coverage with 64 bins in $\varphi$, grouped in $\varphi$ into 32 sectors in each calorimeter. 
		Each hadronic calorimeter therefore has tower size of $\delta \eta = 0.092$ and $\delta \varphi=0.098$.  
		The outer hadronic calorimeter is constructed of steel and sits outside of the magnet, with inner radius of $r=1.82$ m and outer radius of $r=2.69$ m. 
		The inner hadronic calormeter is constructed of aluminum and sits just inside the magnet, with inner radus of $r=1/16$ m and outer radius of $r=1.37$ m. 
		Each tower corresponds to a readout board that sums readout from four scintillator paddles embeded into the calorimeter as show in fig. \ref{fig:hcal}. 
		These interface boards form a single readout channel, and can be indvidually teste via a pulser system that injects charge into the interface board testing readback independent of scintillator response, and LED system that injects a fixed pulse of light into the scintilators to test behavior of the Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). 
		Output of each of these systems is shown in fig \ref{fig:hcal_tests}

		\subsubsection{Calibration}
			The hadronic calorimeters were intially calibrated through use of cosmic ray muons, matching the spectra to Monte Carlo 
			generated through EcoMug and GEANT4 \cite{HCal_Calib}. 
			This calibration is updated through out the run via continued cosmic ray studies in between physics data taking in addition
			to ongoing work on in-situo calibrations using tower-slope methods \cite{tower_slope_hcal}. 
			These calibrations have yeilded an average conversion factor for the OHCal of and the IHCal of %*put ing the factor here*%
	\subsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}
		Moving in one layer from the hadronic calorimeter, the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) has the same coverage in $\eta-\varphi$ space,
		but has 16 times as many towers with 96 bins in $\eta$ and 256 bins in $\varphi$. 
		The EMCal is constructed of blocks of tungsten with embedded scintilationg fibers, 
		and had inner radius $r=0.9$ m and outer radius of $r=1.16$ m.
		Similarly to the HCals, the EMCal is also equipped with a pulser and LED, although the increased number of towers and higher varaiblility 
		in response requires that different pulse widths be used for seperate sets of towers to prevent saturation and clipping on the LED pulse.
		\subsubsection{Calibration}
			The EMCal was calibrated to the $\pi^0$ mass through the $\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma \gamma$ decay channel with additional corrections
			applied via the tower slope. 
			The mean $m_{\pi^0}$ and width are used as quality assurance plots to monitor radiation damage to the EMCal on an ongoing basis.
	\subsection{Zero Degree Calorimeter}
		The Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) is a small transverse energy hadron detector that positioned outside of the experiment hall, in the tunnels along the beam pipe, 18 m from the interaction point on both side.
		The ZDC is used to detect spectator neutrons to allow for the calculation of multiplicity and event geometry, making it an overlapping detector between the calorimeters and the event characterization \cite{sphenix_ZDC}. 
		In addition, the ZDC provides a good proxy for total collision rates, useful for both real time monitoring of beam conditions and 
		The sPHENIX ZDC is one of two detectors that was preserved from PHENIX, with minor repairs and upgrades to improve running.
		In pp collisions, the ZDC provides additional utility as a spin momentum detector that allows for measurment of the spin patterns of the RHIC beam through the Vernier Scan. 
		This functionality is pivotal for the development of sPHENIX's spin physics program in pp and its extensions into the continuing physics goals at the Electron Ion Collider (EIC)\cite{sphenix_ZDC}.
		For the purposes of this work, the ZDC is not utilized for either spin phyiscs or trigger capabilities and serves primiarily to help establish cross-sections for error determination. 
		While this work does not dive into the subject of spin depenendence, such topics are a natural extension and present an intresting avenue for future studies in this vien to be done with the sPHENIX Run 24 data set.

\chapter{The Energy Correlator and the primary vertex}
	So the energy correlator alows a look back, I guess thats the relevant bit? 
	Point being, if the jet points back to the primary vertex, the share of the energy between the jets and the composition of those jets is directly determined by the $2 \rightarrow 2$ scattering and is thus sensitive to the parton distribution functions of the beam particles. 
	Starting from the definition of the energy correlator given in \cite{Larkoski2013}:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{E}_{N} = \int \frac{\dd \Omega}{2} \int \dd \vec{n}_{12} \frac{\langle \varepsilon \left( \vec{n}_1 \right) ... \varepsilon \left(\vec{n}_2 \right)\rangle}{Q^2} \delta\left( \vec{n}_1 \cdot \vec{n}_2 - 2|\vec{n}_1|||\vec{n}_2|\cos  \theta \right)
		\label{eq:ENC}
	\end{equation}

\section{Jet Identification Algorithms}
As discussed in chapter \ref{ch:LR}, there are a variety of jet finding algorithms that prioritize different theoretical aspects of the underlying physics while being experimentally realizable \cite{Dokshitzer1997} \cite{Atkin2015}. 

In general, a jet identification algorithm needs to be IRC safe. 
That is, the jet object needs to display invariance in the Infrared (IR) and Collinear regimes, managing real-virtual cancellation and keeping results meaningful for emission and splitting respectively.
